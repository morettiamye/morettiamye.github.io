        <!-- Bio -->
        <p>My name is Amy.  I'm a front end web developer, with an unhealthy love for CSS and all things style sheets.  I started out designing and building websites for friends back in the early 2000s, when in-line scrolling frames were all the rage and we built our designs in Paintshop Pro.</p>
        
        <p>Fast forward about 15 years, I've now had a career as a <a href="http://www.expressjet.com" target="_blank">flight attendant</a> and spent a considerable amount of time in <a href="https://xkcd.com/1743/" target= "_blank">specialty coffee</a>. I guess you could say I love traveling and good coffee.</p>
        
        <p>My back end developer <a href="../tony/">husband</a> helped me reignite my passion for web development and design, leading me to enroll at the <a href="https://bootcamp.northwestern.edu/coding/" target="_blank">Northwestern University Web Dev Bootcamp.</a>  I've brushed up on HTML and CSS, and stuck my toes in the JavaScript water.  Now I'm excited to see where web development can take me.</p>
