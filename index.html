        <!-- Bio -->
        <p>My name is Amy. I'm a front end web developer, with an unhealthy love for CSS and all things style sheets. I started
            out designing and building websites for friends back in the early 2000s, when in-line scrolling frames were all
            the rage and we built our designs in Paintshop Pro.</p>

        <p>Fast forward about 15 years, I've now had a career as a <a href="http://www.expressjet.com" target="_blank">flight
                attendant</a> and spent a considerable amount of time in <a href="https://xkcd.com/1743/" target="_blank">specialty
                coffee</a>. I guess you could say I love traveling and good coffee.</p>

        <p>My back end developer <a href="../tony/">husband</a> helped me reignite my passion for web development and design,
            leading me to enroll at the <a href="https://bootcamp.northwestern.edu/coding/" target="_blank">Northwestern
                University Web Dev Bootcamp.</a> I've brushed up on HTML and CSS, and stuck my toes in the JavaScript water.
            Now I'm excited to see where web development can take me.</p>

        <p class="pText">
            Created as our first group project during bootcamp, appDoption is a web application aimed at delivering an image forward browsing experience for finding adoptable pets in your area.  Connected with the api from <a href="http://www.petfinder.com" target="blank">Petfinder</a>, adoptable cats and dogs are searchable via zipcode search.  My primary role on this project was UI design and development.

        <p class="pText">
            A simple cat themed hangman game created using JavaScript.  This was one of my initial homework assignments and at the time, quite a challenge.

        <p class="pText">
            A game similar to blackjack, in which you click crystals to try to reach a certain score to win.  This was my first adventure into using jQuery in a homework assignment.
