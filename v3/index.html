           <p>Hi! I'm <h1>Amy Moretti</h1><br/>
            I'm a front end developer in Chicago.<br/>
            I create responsive, accessible websites.<br/>
            I also love cats and fancy coffee.

        <p>I started out designing and building websites for friends back in the early 2000s, when in-line scrolling frames were all the rage and we built our designs in Paintshop Pro.  More than 15 years later, I've now had a career as a <a href="https://www.expressjet.com/" target="_blank">flight attendant</a> and spent a considerable amount of time in <a href="https://xkcd.com/1743/" target="_blank">specialty coffee</a>, but always felt myself missing web development.  In the summer of 2018 I decided to leave my management position at a local coffee roaster to pursue development, and attended the <a href="https://bootcamp.northwestern.edu/coding/" target="_blank">Northwestern University Full Stack Coding Bootcamp</a> to bring my skills up to date.  Since then I have learned to love JavaScript and CSS, and prefer to focus on creating efficient, responsive, and accessible websites.</p>
        <p>My software developer husband <a href="https://www.moreready.com/tony/" target="_blank">Tony</a> and I live in the Edgewater neighborhood of Chicago along with our two cats Eloise and Fruff.  When not working on web development, I can be found drinking lattes, playing video games, and cross stitching.  I am also an avid collector of animation cels from my two favorite magical girl animes, Sailor Moon and Cardcaptor Sakura.  This hobby has led me to spending many late nights and early mornings bidding against others on Yahoo! Japan Auctions.</p>

        <p>A front-end, photos focused application for searching adoptable pets in your area. This application was created with the usability of Instagram in mind and connects with the Petfinder API, and was created as a way to easily view adoptable pets in the searched area.
        This was completed as my first project for web development bootcamp. My role on this project was as project manager and UI/UX design and development. For this project I chose to learn the Materialize CSS framework, which ultimately led me gaining much better grasp of responsiveness and CSS gridding to achieve the desired layout.</p>
        <p>Upon completion of bootcamp this was the first project I wanted to revisit. I spent additional time improving the UI to be more heavily similar to Instagram, as a large portion of our feedback was that given the goals of the project, the instruction team wanted to see it look and feel more like Instagram. With more time and fewer hard requirements, I was also able to improve upon the useage of the api and add an initial display of random results, so that the user could see what sort of content would be displayed once a search was conducted. Each step of the way I ensured that Appdoption would function just as easily on mobile as it does on desktop. In going back through this project I also worked to remove almost all uses of jQuery to improve performance.  The only useage is for a simple ajax call, as the no-CORS API does not work with the .fetch() method.  I opted not to route the api via a backend server as the document for Petfinder specifically says to not worry about hiding your API key and that being used purely on the front end is recommended.

        <p>Is Gravity Still Working started as a joke, offhandedly made in a Slack channel of friends.  I, having plenty of free time that day, decided to make the joke a reality and purchased <a href="https://www.isgravitystillworking.com" target="_blank">IsGravityStillWorking.com</a>.  The site is simple, when the page loads a random gif of a cat knocking something over is loaded.  The site started with 14 gifs, and a dropbox folder for adding new ones as we found ones we liked. It was simple to write the Javascript, and even simpler to create the design.  It reminds me a lot of an original internet treasure called You're the Man Now Dog, which was a community of users that would tie together gifs or static images and soundclips to create jokes.  Is Gravity Still Working is simple, but perfectly so and was built exactly as intended.</p>

        <a href="https://campaignquery.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank"><img src="assets/images/cq2.png" alt="Campaign Query Screenshot"></a>
        <p>Created as our second bootcamp project (and first full stack project), Campaign Query aims to display campaign finance data with easy readability.  This project utilizes Amcharts and Highcharts in conjuction with the Federal Election Commission API routed through a backend Express server using node.JS.  My role for this project was project manager in addition to UX/UI and assisting with API calls. My goal with this project was to use simple, modular CSS as opposed to using a framework. It turned out to be much more difficult than initially anticipated, but I was ultimately able to make it work and was very happy with the result.  Campaign Query received high praise and we were later told it was shared among the administrators because of how interesting our instructors found it. </p>
        <p>I plan to reapproach Campaign Query in the coming months so that it can be useful for the 2020 election cycle.</p>

            <a href="https://morettiamye.github.io/pikachu-rumble" target="_blank"><img src="assets/images/pikachu.png" alt="Pikachu Rumble"></a>
        <p>Pikachu Rumble is a simple JavaScript game made in an afternoon as a simple refresher exercise.  I based it's functionality off of a simple Javascript game made early in the bootcamp program I attended, which was called Crystal Collector.  The game is simple -- hit points and attack power are all chosen at random, and for each attack from the user the opposing Pokemon counterattacks.  The first one to zero wins!  </p>

            <p>MoreReady.com belongs to my husband and I and houses personal work and portfolios.  Tony has owned this domain since before we met, and it was originally a source of confusion until I realized that MoreReady is a play on his very common Italian last name, Moretti.  I maintain this for us, and built the landing page and his single page resume using Bootstrap.</p>
