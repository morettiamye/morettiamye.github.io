<h1>Personal Portfolio</h1>

This is my personal portfolio site designed to show my resume and experience.  I opted to code things out using vanilla CSS and HTML because while frameworks are fun, I wanted to make an effort to make something with my own skills.

My design preference is for simple, clean designs, hence the minimal black and white approach.


<h2>To-Dos</h2>
I need to go back and add media queries for responsiveness.
